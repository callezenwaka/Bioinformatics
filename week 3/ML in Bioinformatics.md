*GC Content Calculation*
- GC content refers to the percentage of guanine (G) and cytosine (C) bases in a DNA sequence.
- GC content can be calculated using the following formula: GC content = (G + C) / (A + T + G + C) x 100
- GC content is important in bioinformatics because it can affect the melting temperature of DNA, which is crucial for PCR and other molecular biology techniques.

*Fasta File Manipulation*
- FASTA (Fast-All) is a text-based format for representing biological sequences, such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.
- FASTA files typically consist of a header line followed by the sequence data.
- Common operations on FASTA files include:
    - Extracting specific sequences or regions
    - Filtering sequences based on length, GC content, or other criteria
    - Converting between different sequence formats

Introduction to Machine Learning in Bioinformatics
*What is Machine Learning?*
- Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data.
- Machine learning can be supervised (i.e., training on labeled data), unsupervised (i.e., training on unlabeled data), or semi-supervised (i.e., training on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data).

*Applications of Machine Learning in Bioinformatics*
- Predicting protein structure and function
- Identifying genetic variants associated with disease
- Classifying biological sequences (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein)
- Analyzing gene expression data
- Identifying potential drug targets

*Common Machine Learning Algorithms in Bioinformatics*
- Neural networks
- Decision trees
- Random forests
- Support vector machines (SVMs)
- k-means clustering

*Tools and Resources for Machine Learning in Bioinformatics*
- scikit-learn (Python library)
- TensorFlow (Python library)
- PyTorch (Python library)
- BioPython (Python library)
- R (programming language)
- WEKA (Java library)

*Challenges and Limitations of Machine Learning in Bioinformatics*
- Dealing with high-dimensional data
